This module is depreciated.  Please use Digest::SHA1 instead.

This module (SHA.pm) is just a thin wrapper around the Digest::SHA1
module.  It is provided so that legacy code that rely on the old
interface continue to work.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
The Digest::SHA1 module must be installed.
